	<h2>Selected Machine learning projects!</h2>
<li>Detecting hand gestures on existing unmodified smartphones using Wi-Fi signal strength (thesis).</li>
<li>Building a video search engine using deep learning to exploit the video content, elasticsearch for indexing and kibana as a user interface.</li>
<li>Predicting human face attributes from images with deep learning.</li>
<li>Implementing a deep neural network for a speech recognition task (phoneme prediction), using Caffe deep learning framework.</li>
<li>Learning to play Packman with reinforcement learning using neural networks. FANN neural network library was used.(Youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV9xViSfoBA)</li>
