Last week I presented the topic of deep Q-learning to a group of engineers who work with machine learning at Ericsson (where I am currently working). You can access the presentation by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xzo49RvQH7uHpqBkd_votYQ-uaAjO3KReotC8ifRsl0/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).

In relation to this, I've previously built a Pac-Man player that uses Q-learning to learn how to play the game. You can read more about it [here](https://mohaseeb.github.io/machine%20learning/2015/06/01/pack-man/).
