Employing various signal processing and time series classification techniques coupled with a careful engineered system, I am pushing the boundary, by trying to predict hand gestures near unmodified smartphones using the Wi-Fi RSSI measurements recored by the smartphone wireless driver. By unmodified smartphone, I am highlighting the fact that no additional hardware or special firmware is used.

This work is ongoing, and I will provide more details when it is done; hopefully by autumn.
