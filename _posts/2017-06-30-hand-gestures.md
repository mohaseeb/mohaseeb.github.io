Wisture is a solution for recognizing touch-less dynamic hand gestures
on smartphones from the Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS). A Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is trained to
predict hand gestures from a pre-processed Wi-Fi RSS input sequence.
Unlike other Wi-Fi based gesture recognition methods, the proposed
method does not require a modifying the smartphone hardware or the o
perating system, and performs the gesture recognition without
interfering with the normal operation of other smartphone applications.

Refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08569)
for more details.

Below is a video demonstration of Wisture.
