### Welcome!

I am interested in automation and building solutions that employ machine
learning and AI techniques([checkout my blog](blog/)).

I currently work as a machine learning engineer at Watty, building
Watty's machine learning based energy analytics product. Before
Watty, I worked for Ericsson as software and systems engineer. I spend part of my free time building sites and mobile apps using node, React, React Native and Ionic.

I hold a Master in machine learning from KTH (Royal Institute of
Technology) Sweden, and a Bachelor degree in electrical engineering
from university of Khartoum in Sudan.
