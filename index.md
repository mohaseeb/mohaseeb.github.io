### Welcome, I'm Mohamed Haseeb!

I am an experienced software and systems engineer, currently working at Ericsson in Sweden. I've patience to solve problems and passion to explore
and learn new things and I do often come with original ideas. I program in several languages and have experience on several machine learning techniques ([checkout my blog](blog/)). I am currently interested in building solutions that employ machine learning and AI
techniques.

My bachelor was in electrical engineering, and I am currently concluding a master in machine learning at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) of Sweden.

If not with my wife and two daughters, I spend my free time, running, watching movies/series, learning, working in a hobby project and sometimes reading a book.
