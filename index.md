I am interested in automation and building solutions that employ machine
learning and AI techniques.

I currently work as a data scientist at Webstep where I work as a consultant 
on client projects. Before that I worked as a machine learning engineer at Watty
 building machine learning based energy analytics products and as software & systems engineer at Ericsson.

I spend part of my free time building web and mobile apps using node, React, 
React Native and Ionic.

I hold a Master in machine learning from KTH (Royal Institute of
Technology) Sweden, and a Bachelor degree in electrical engineering
from university of Khartoum in Sudan.
