### Welcome, I'm Mohamed Abdulaziz Ali Haseeb,

I currently work as a machine learning engineer at Watty. I am interested in automation and building solutions that employ machine learning and AI
techniques([checkout my blog](blog/)). Before watty, I worked for Ericsson as software and systems engineer.

I hold a Master in machine learning from KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) Sweden, and a Bachelor degree in electrical engineering from university of Khartoum in Sudan.

If not with my wife and daughters, I spend my free time, running, watching movies/series, learning, working in a hobby project and sometimes reading a book.
