### Welcome, I'm Mohamed Haseeb!

Experienced software and systems engineer (8+ years), with patience to solve problems and passion to explore
and learn new things. I program in several languages and have experience on several machine learning and AI
techniques; [checkout my blog]() . I am currently interested in building solutions that employ machine learning and AI
techniques.

My bachelor was in electrical engineering, and I am currently concluding a master in machine learning at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) of Sweden.

If not with my wife and two daughters, I spend my free time, running, learning, working in a hobby project, sometimes reading a book, and well, many times hopping around in the internet.
